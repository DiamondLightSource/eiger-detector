Quickstart Guide
================

This Quickstart guide will show you how to run a software stack containing
a full set of control applications for an Eiger detector.  The default 
settings will run a simulator in place of real hardware to allow immediate 
demonstration and testing.  Replacing the simulator with a real detector 
requires minimal configuration changes and will be explained in the step
by step instructions.
